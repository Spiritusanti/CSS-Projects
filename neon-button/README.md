# Neon Button Project
trying out building a Neon themed button with CSS inspired by Kevin Powell's video @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xNcXwC6ikQ

# Kevin's Code:
Added in index.html and style.css
--> the use of psuedo elements is definitely something I need to work on understanding more
--> first time I have seen the transform: perspective(); Will definitely need to remember that for the future!
--> approach to button using "a" tag is useful - cuts down on extra code from what I can see. May want to research more on the difference between anchor and button elements.

# My Code:
my initial attempt is contained in index_attempt1 and style_attempt1
--> able to get the basic button styling but not able to figure out the pseudo element approach.
--> relatively easy for me to get the basic styling down without a lot of effort! I'm making progress!
